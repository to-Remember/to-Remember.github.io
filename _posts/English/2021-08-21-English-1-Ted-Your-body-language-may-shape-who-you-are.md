[Your body language may shape who you are](https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_may_shape_who_you_are?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare)      


***Body language affects how others see us, but it may also change how we see ourselves. Social psychologist Amy Cuddy argues that "power posing" -- standing in a posture of confidence, even when we don't feel confident -- can boost feelings of confidence, and might have an impact on our chances for success.***          


I brought some words or sentences below.       


>A free no-tech **life hack**        
**All it requires of you is** **this that** you change your posture for two minutes.       
If you learn to tweak this a little bit, **it could significantly change the way your life unfolds.**       
An awkward interaction        
A **contemptuous** glance        
We make **sweeping judgements and inferences** from body language.       
We can predict really meaningful life outcomes.       
Emoticons used well in online negotiations **can lead you to claim more value from that negotiation.** If you use that poorly, bad idea.        
We don’t want to **bump into** the person next to us.        
When you feel powerful, you’re more likely to do this, but it’s also possible that when you pretend to be powerful, you **are more likely to actually feel powerful**.       
We know our nonverbals govern how other people think and feel about us.       
It goes both ways.       
Our minds change our bodies, and it’s also true that our bodies change our minds.       
What do the **minds of the powerful versus the powerless** look like?       
Powerful people tend to be more **assertive** and more confident, more optimistic.       
They actually feel they’re going to win even **at games of chance.**       
Power is also about how you react to stress.       
You want the person who’s powerful and assertive and dominant, but not very **stress reactive**, the person who’s **laid back**.       
You’re folding up, you’re making yourself small.       
When you’re touching your neck, you’re really protecting yourself.       
That’s a **whopping** significant difference.        
**Configure your brain to** basically be either assertive, confident and comfortable, or stress-reactive, and **feeling sort of shut down**.       
Power posing for a few minutes really change my life in meaningful ways.       
This is worse than being **heckled**.       
**“Standing in social quicksand”.**        
This is what’s driving the effect or **mediating** the effect.
